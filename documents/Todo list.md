# Todo list

1. Make the in memory object creation to file tree persistent.
2. Make the functionality so that when someone modifies files inside the file system  directory manually the file tree re initiates itself.
3. Find a way nice way to access already existent files inside the file tree.
4. Find a way to copy parts of the file system to another.

# Issues

1. Prevent mix and matching of file tree's. One file tree of one particular file system implementation is completely different from another and must not be mixed. 

# Ideas

Assuming someone always uses the correct file tree can we move on?
