## Questions

- Can one file be in more than one directory parent? No, when fetching the parent... what parent do you pick then?

## TODO

- File contents; appending, prepending
- Renaming objects
- Refactor the tests

- File tree finding capabilities ( or a finder )
- Automate file tree syncing
- Maybe some way to couple file tree to file system to prevent mistakes
