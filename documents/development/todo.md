# File system todo

- Check if content can be put directly into file
- Consider and check if path is needed on file, maybe instead only pick file name and let path be handled by the file system
- Inside file make up a way to handle double extensions on a file. right now tar.gz will only return .gz as the extension
- API to create new directory
